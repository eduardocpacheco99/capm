`capm` is a [R](http://www.r-project.org/) package, a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. 


`capm` stands for **C**ompanion **A**nimal **P**opulation **M**anagement and is an initiative to guide and automate quantitative analysis to support companion animal population management.

Current version offer functions that allow users to implement the following workflow:

1. Calculation of size and composition for a complex pilot sampling design.
2. Selection of sampling units according to previous step.
3. Mapping primary sampling units to be visited.
4. Calculation of size and composition for a complex (final) sampling design.
5. Repetition of steps 2 and 3, using sample data.
6. Estimation of demographic characteristics (totals, proportions, means and ratios).
7. Construction of population pyramids, conditioned on sex, age and another categorical variable such as reproductive status.
8. Assessment of the effect produced by population management intervention, through mathematical modelling.
9. Classification of interventions according to the effect they produce, through sensitivity analysis.

You can use `install_github()` from `devtools` package to install the development version or wait for a more stable version uploaded to CRAN.
