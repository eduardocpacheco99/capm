`capm` is a package for [R](http://www.r-project.org/), a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. 


`capm` stands for **C**ompanion **A**nimal **P**opulation **M**anagement and is an initiative to guide and automate quantitative analysis to support companion animal population management.

Current version offers functions that allow users to implement the following workflow:

1. Selection of sampling units for simple and complex surveys.
2. Mapping primary sampling units to be visited (complex surveys).
3. Calculation of size and composition for a complex (final) sampling design.
4. Repetition of steps 1 and 2, for the final survey.
5. Estimation of demographic characteristics (totals, proportions, means and ratios).
6. Construction of population pyramids, conditioned on sex, age and another categorical variable such as reproductive status.
7. Assessment of the effect produced by population management interventions, through mathematical modelling.
8. Prioritize interventions according to the effect they produce, through sensitivity analysis.

You can use `install_github()` from `devtools` package to install the development version or wait for a more stable version uploaded to CRAN.

**Current developement version:** 0.2.3
