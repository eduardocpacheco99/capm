capm 0.4.3
==========

* GraphicInterface: support for simple and stratified designs. sidebarPanel layout changed to multiple columns.

* CalculateSimpleSampleSize: new function to calculate sample size under simple or systematic designs.

* CalculateStratifiedSampleSize: new function to calculate sample size under simple or systematic designs.

* DesignSurvey: now supports simple and stratified designs. Arguments for column specification accept names or position to index columns.

* Calculate2StageSampleSize: level argument renamed as conf.level.

* SampleSystematic: code adapted to allow sampling in each strata of a stratified sampling design. Arguments ssu and total renamed as su and N, respectively.

* SummarySurvey: variables created to define the type of design now do not appear as variables to be estimated. Argumetn level renamed as conf.level. Position of the first two arguments exchanged.

* pilot, psu.ssu and survey.data: updated to include the rural area of Santos.


capm 0.4.2
==========

* GraphicInterface (SelectedSamplingUnits): a CSV file with selected sampling units can be downloaded and KML files of selected PSU can be written. 

* GraphicInterface: bug fixed to load the necessary packages and pages are created with fluidPge function.

* MapkmlPSU: function code simplification.

* SampleSystematic: rise and error if sample units to be selected are greater than sampling units in the population.

* CITATION: update.

capm 0.4.1
==========

* GraphicInterface: bug fixed to load the necessary packages.

capm 0.4
========

* CITATION file added.

* PlotPopPyramid: documentation improvements.

* GraphicInterface: bug fixed to plot global and local sensitivity analysis when "SolveIasa" argument is used (thanks to Ricardo Dias who detected the bug).

capm 0.3.2
==========

* Calculate2StageSampleSize: minor documentation improvements.

* CalculatePopChange: minor documentation improvements.

* survey.data: new variables to improve examples.

* GraphicInterface: update in SurveyAnalysis to use examples based on survey.data.

capm 0.3.1
==========

pilot, psu.ssu, survey.data: updated data files to improve examples. `pilot` file now represents 10 PSU and 5 SSU per SSU (a more realistic pilot sample). `survey.data` file now has 469 observations.

* PlotPopPyramid: bug fixed to prevent generation of NA's during internal data transformations. Now calling the function do not produce warning messages.

* shapefile for examples: wkbPolygon with 2 dimensions, insted of 3 dimension do not produce warning messages.

* GraphicInterface: complete documentation.

* "Debian" directory removed.

* Directory tree restructured to match CRAN requirements.

* Examples for functions simplified to be run in less time.

* General documentation improvements.
