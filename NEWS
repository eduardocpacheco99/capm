capm 0.7.0
==========
* Changes intended to appear in version 0.6.0 were not included. Now they appear in this version.

capm 0.6.0
==========

capm 0.5.2

==========
* NAMESPACE and capm-package.R: Generated by roxygen2 (4.1.0).
  
capm 0.5.1
==========

* Now depends on Depends: R (>= 3.1.2).

* GraphicInterface: bug fix to avoid an error when Windows users define a path directory using the "SelectSamplingUnits" interface.

* GraphicInterface (CalculateSampleSize): name of a function argument corrected. New argument for Calculate2StageSampleSize is available. Names of function arguments were updated for compatibility with newer shiny versions.

* GraphicInterface (SelectSamplingUnits): Title added to an uploaded file. Names of function arguments were updated for compatibility with newer shiny versions.

* GraphicInterface (SurveyAnalysis): summary statistics for sample data now exclude columns with sampling unit ID's (datasets for two stage cluster designs). For printing, uploaded sample data is coerced to character to avoid scientific notation. Names of function arguments were updated for compatibility with newer shiny versions.

* PlotPopPyramid: "label.size" argument added to allow control labels font size.

* SampleSystematic: the computed interval size is rounded dwon to make all intervals of the same size.

* Calculate2StageSampleSize: new argument "minimum.ssu" to define the minimum number of SSU to be selected in each PSU.



capm 0.5
========

* Production version of the previous 0.4.3 version.

capm 0.4.3
==========

* GraphicInterface: support for simple and stratified designs. sidebarPanel layout changed to multiple columns.

* CalculateSimpleSampleSize: new function to calculate sample size under simple or systematic designs.

* CalculateStratifiedSampleSize: new function to calculate sample size under simple or systematic designs.

* DesignSurvey: now supports simple and stratified designs. Arguments for column specification accept names or position to index columns.

* Calculate2StageSampleSize: level argument renamed as conf.level.

* SampleSystematic: code adapted to allow sampling in each strata of a stratified sampling design. Arguments ssu and total renamed as su and N, respectively.

* SummarySurvey: variables created to define the type of design now do not appear as variables to be estimated. Argumetn level renamed as conf.level. Position of the first two arguments exchanged.

* pilot, psu.ssu and survey.data: updated to include the rural area of Santos.


capm 0.4.2
==========

* GraphicInterface (SelectedSamplingUnits): a CSV file with selected sampling units can be downloaded and KML files of selected PSU can be written. 

* GraphicInterface: bug fixed to load the necessary packages and pages are created with fluidPge function.

* MapkmlPSU: function code simplification.

* SampleSystematic: rise and error if sample units to be selected are greater than sampling units in the population.

* CITATION: update.

capm 0.4.1
==========

* GraphicInterface: bug fixed to load the necessary packages.

capm 0.4
========

* CITATION file added.

* PlotPopPyramid: documentation improvements.

* GraphicInterface: bug fixed to plot global and local sensitivity analysis when "SolveIasa" argument is used (thanks to Ricardo Dias who detected the bug).

capm 0.3.2
==========

* Calculate2StageSampleSize: minor documentation improvements.

* CalculatePopChange: minor documentation improvements.

* survey.data: new variables to improve examples.

* GraphicInterface: update in SurveyAnalysis to use examples based on survey.data.

capm 0.3.1
==========

pilot, psu.ssu, survey.data: updated data files to improve examples. `pilot` file now represents 10 PSU and 5 SSU per SSU (a more realistic pilot sample). `survey.data` file now has 469 observations.

* PlotPopPyramid: bug fixed to prevent generation of NA's during internal data transformations. Now calling the function do not produce warning messages.

* shapefile for examples: wkbPolygon with 2 dimensions, insted of 3 dimension do not produce warning messages.
