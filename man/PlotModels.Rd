\usage{
PlotModels(model.out = NULL, variable = NULL, col = "red",
  col1 = c("cadetblue1", "yellow", "red"), col2 = c("blue", "darkgreen",
  "darkred"), x.label = "Years", y.label = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{model.out}{output of one of the function previously mentioned.}

\item{variable}{string to specify the variable to be ploted.

For \code{\link{SolveSI}} function:

"n" (population size).

"q" (proportion of sterilized animals).

For \code{\link{SolveIASA}} function using only point estimates:

"f1" (owned intact females).

"fs1" (owned sterilized females).

"m1" (owned intact males).

"ms1" (owned sterilized males).

"f2" (stray intact females).

"fs2" (stray sterilized females).

"m2" (stray intact males).

"ms2" (stray sterilized males).

"n1" (owned intact animals).

"ns1" (owned sterilized animals).

"n2" (stray intact animals).

"ns2" (stray sterilized animals).

"N1" (owned animals).

"N2" (stray animals).

"N" (total population).

For \code{\link{SolveIASA}} function using *.range arguments:

"f" (intact females).

"fs" (sterilized females).

"m" (intact males).

"ms" (sterilized males).

"n" (intact animals).

"ns" (sterilized animals).

"N" (Total population stratified by reproductive status).

For \code{\link{SolveTC}} function:

"n" (fertile animals).

"ns" (sterilized animals).

"tns" (cumulative of sterilized animals)}

\item{col}{string indicating the color of ploted line, when \code{s.range} is \code{NULL}.}

\item{col1}{\code{\link{character}} \code{\link{vector}} indicating the color of lowest (highest) population sizes (proportion of sterilized animals), when \code{s.range} is not \code{NULL}.}

\item{col2}{\code{\link{character}} \code{\link{vector}} indicating the color of highest (lowest) population sizes (proportion of sterilized animals), when \code{s.range} is not \code{NULL}.}

\item{x.label}{string with the name of x axis.}

\item{y.label}{string with the name of y axis.}

\item{scen.label}{string with the name of scenarios of \code{\link{SolveIASA}} output, determined by the immigartion rates. Within the string, use the expression __ in the location where you want to appear the value of the immigartion rate. For line breaking, use \code{\\n} (see examples).}

\item{leg.label}{string with the name of legend, for plots of \code{\link{SolveIASA}} output.}

\item{pop}{value indicating the output of \code{\link{SolveIASA}} to be ploted. When \code{NULL} (default), plots for owned and stray populations under scenarios created by immigartion rate are created. If \code{1}, the plots of owned population for the minimum immigartion rate are ploted. When \code{2}, the plots of stray population for the minimum immigartion rate are ploted. If \code{3}, the plots of owned population for the maximum immigartion rate are ploted. When \code{4}, the plots of owned population for the maximum immigartion rate are ploted.}
}
\description{
Plot results of one of the following functions: \code{\link{SolveIASA}}, \code{\link{SolveSI}} or \code{\link{SolveTC}}.
}
\details{
Font size of saved plots is usually different to the font size seen in graphic browsers. Before changing font sizes, see the final result in saved (or preview) plots.

Other details of the plot can be modifyed using appropriate functions from \code{ggplot2} package.

# Uncomment the following line:

## Plot all scenarios and change the label for the scenarios.
# Uncomment the following line:
# PlotModels(solveiasa.rg, variable = 'ns')
