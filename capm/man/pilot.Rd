\title{
  Pilot study to calculate sample size and composition
}
\description{
  This data set list secondary sampling units (ssu) selected with the \code{\link{siss}} function, within 20 primary sampling units (psu) from a sampling frame of Santos city, selected with the \code{\link{ppssr}} function. For each ssu, there is a number of dogs, simulated from a poisson ditribution, with lambda equal to the weighted mean (0.88) of number od fogs per ssu observed in field studies. The pilot is intended to calculate sample size and composition to estimate owned dog population size.
